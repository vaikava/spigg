spigg.js
============
spigg.js brings the *Data mapper* pattern to node.js, giving you database-
agnostic **mappers** for data persistence and **entities** for business
logic, to ensure DRY principles and testability across your application.

spigg.js is lightweight by design and only ships with a handful of methods
to get, set, unset and clear your data and thereby leaves everything else
up to you.

Read about the *data mapper* pattern [here](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html).
